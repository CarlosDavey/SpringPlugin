# SpringPlugin

Portfolio of publicly accessible source code for my Spring Reverb Plugin.

Of particular note are the PluginProcessor.cpp and the RefinedSpringModal.cpp files.

This plugin uses a novel mathematical model of spring reverberation I developed using modal decomposition. It is employed in real time using interpolated lookup tables.
